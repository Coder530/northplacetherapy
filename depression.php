        <h1>DEPRESSION AND LOW MOOD</h1>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Depression</h2>
            <p>Depression is a common experience, but it is highly treatable with therapy. Symptoms often include persistent low mood for most of the day, nearly every day, and a loss of pleasure in activities for at least a two-week period. Physical symptoms may include changes in appetite, weight, and sleep patterns, as well as feelings of restlessness, irritability, or lethargy. Psychological symptoms may include feelings of worthlessness and frequent thoughts about death.</p>
            
            <p>Depression can also affect motivation, making it difficult to carry out everyday activities, even leaving the house. It often involves negative thoughts about self-worth and assumptions about how others perceive or judge you.</p>
            
            <p>Therapy provides a well-evidenced starting point for improvement. By exploring the issues contributing to depression and making gradual changes, it is possible to feel better and live well. More information on depression is provided below.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Depression Information</h2>
            <blockquote>
                "If you know someone who's depressed, please resolve never to ask them why. Depression isn't a straightforward response to a bad situation; depression just is, like the weather." – <em>Stephen Fry</em>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Depression is common. Studies show that up to 10% of people in England will experience depression in their lifetime. Mixed anxiety and depression is the most common mental health disorder in Britain, affecting around 8% of people clinically. Many people experience temporary low moods, but depression persists for weeks, months, or even longer.</p>
            
            <p>A diagnosis is usually made when deeper, longer-lasting periods of low mood and unhappiness are accompanied by a range of symptoms:</p>
            
            <h3>You may feel:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Worthless or hopeless</li>
                <li>That life isn't worth living</li>
                <li>Constantly anxious, tearful, or worried</li>
                <li>Unable to concentrate or make decisions</li>
                <li>Irritable or intolerant of others</li>
                <li>A lack of enjoyment in life</li>
                <li>Low self-esteem</li>
                <li>Excessive guilt</li>
                <li>No motivation or interest in activities you previously enjoyed</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>You may notice physical changes, such as:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Altered sleep patterns (insomnia or oversleeping)</li>
                <li>Changes in appetite (loss or overeating)</li>
                <li>Fatigue or low energy</li>
                <li>Persistent headaches, stomach issues, or chronic pain</li>
                <li>Slower speech</li>
                <li>Reduced libido or menstrual cycle changes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>You may also:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Withdraw from hobbies and interests</li>
                <li>Isolate yourself from friends and family</li>
                <li>Reduce social participation</li>
                <li>Experience lower productivity at work</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Depression can develop gradually, and sometimes it takes a friend or family member to recognize it. Everyone experiences depression differently, both physically and psychologically. This is not a state of mind that can be "snapped out of"—a severe depressive episode can leave you housebound and struggling with even basic tasks.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Severity and Causes</h2>
            <p>Depression is classified as a mood disorder and is typically described as mild, moderate, or severe:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mild:</strong> Some impact on daily life</li>
                <li><strong>Moderate:</strong> Significant, noticeable impact</li>
                <li><strong>Severe:</strong> Functioning is almost impossible</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Causes are often complex, involving social, psychological, and biological factors. Life events such as bereavement, trauma, unemployment, or relationship breakdowns can trigger or exacerbate depression, creating a vicious cycle where symptoms lead to further stress and hopelessness. Biological factors, such as hormonal changes or low testosterone, can also play a role.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Recovery and Support</h2>
            <p>Most people recover from depression, but it can persist or recur for some. It is important to keep your doctor informed, as antidepressants may be prescribed (see resources page for further information). Talking therapy has proven effectiveness in treating depression and reducing the risk of recurrence. The NHS typically offers short courses of CBT, though wait times can be long, and many people choose to see a private therapist.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Steps You Can Take</h2>
            <p>Self-help strategies include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accept that you are feeling this way and focus on maintaining basic self-care ("life hygiene")</li>
                <li>Talk to someone you trust about your feelings</li>
                <li>Keep active; even short daily walks can help mood and sleep</li>
                <li>Maintain a healthy diet</li>
                <li>Reduce alcohol, which may worsen depression</li>
                <li>Practice relaxing activities before sleep (reading, listening to music, TV)</li>
                <li>Identify and write down problems you can address, then take small, practical steps</li>
                <li>Stay hopeful—depression is common and treatable, and you can emerge stronger</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>There are many helpful resources, such as Mind (see resources page). Stephen Fry's analogy of depression to "the weather" captures the sense of being overwhelmed by forces beyond your control. Depression can feel like a persistent low mood draining color and energy from life. Help is available, and small steps today can begin the recovery process.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Supporting Someone Else</h2>
            <p>Living with depression can be challenging not only for the person affected but also for friends and family. If you are supporting someone, remember to take care of your own well-being too.</p>
        </div>
        
        <hr>

            <h2>Depression (Summary)</h2>
            <p>Depression is a common experience, but it is very treatable with therapy. Symptoms often include low mood most of the day, nearly every day, and a loss of interest or pleasure in activities, typically lasting at least two weeks.

            <p>Depression can also affect motivation, making even simple tasks—like leaving the house—feel difficult. It can impact how you see yourself and assumptions about how others perceive you.</p>
            
            <p>Therapy is a proven starting point. Talking through the issues contributing to depression, and beginning to make positive changes, can help you feel better and regain control over your life.</p>
            
            <h3>Common symptoms of depression include:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Persistent low mood or sadness</li>
                <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities</li>
                <li>Changes in sleep or appetite</li>
                <li>Fatigue or loss of energy</li>
                <li>Difficulty concentrating or making decisions</li>
                <li>Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt</li>
                <li>Irritability, anxiety, or tearfulness</li>
                <li>Social withdrawal or neglecting hobbies</li>
                <li>Physical complaints such as headaches, stomach issues, or chronic pain</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Depression varies in severity: mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the impact on daily life. Causes are often complex, involving social, psychological, and biological factors. Difficult life events—such as bereavement, trauma, relationship breakdowns, or unemployment—can trigger or worsen depressive episodes. Biological factors, like hormonal changes, can also contribute.</p>
            
            <h3>Supporting yourself while dealing with depression:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Accept your current feelings without self-judgment</li>
                <li>Maintain good daily routines, including activity and sleep</li>
                <li>Talk to someone you trust about how you feel</li>
                <li>Eat well and limit alcohol</li>
                <li>Engage in small daily activities or light exercise</li>
                <li>Consider writing down challenges and possible solutions</li>
                <li>Hold onto hope—recovery is possible, and therapy can accelerate the process</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Therapy can help reduce the intensity of symptoms, explore underlying causes, and develop strategies to prevent recurrence. For immediate support or if symptoms are severe, contact your GP or local mental health services.</p>
