        <h1>STRESS MANAGEMENT</h1>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Stress</h2>
            <p>Most of us feel stressed from time to time, but sometimes stress can become intense or prolonged. When stress builds up over time, it can leave us feeling low and struggling with both psychological and physical symptoms. We may feel less able to cope than usual.</p>
            
            <p>Stress often arises from events in our lives, frequently linked to pressures we place on ourselves—or feel from others. Work can be a common source of stress, whether you are a CEO or just starting a new job. Other life events—such as difficult relationships, bereavement, moving house, marriage, or redundancy—can also increase stress levels, sometimes leaving us feeling far from our usual resilient selves.</p>
            
            <p>Sometimes, our own ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving can unintentionally increase stress. We may get stuck in unhelpful patterns that amplify pressure. Stress affects us not only psychologically but physically too. Prolonged stress can alter levels of cortisol, serotonin, and adrenaline/noradrenaline, leaving us physically drained.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Emotionally, you might notice:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased irritability</li>
                <li>Feeling overwhelmed or anxious</li>
                <li>Lowered self-esteem</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Physically, you might experience:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Difficulty sleeping</li>
                <li>Dizziness or palpitations</li>
                <li>Sweating or digestive issues</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>If stress is taking over your life and causing suffering, talking to a therapist can be a constructive step forward.</p>
            
            <p>Therapy can help you manage the symptoms of stress and explore the underlying causes. Together, you can identify the situations that trigger the strongest stress responses and work toward changes that improve both your physical and emotional wellbeing. Therapy can help you regain the sense of control that often feels lost during periods of acute stress.</p>

            <h2>Stress</h2>
            <p>Stress is a normal part of life, but prolonged or intense stress can leave us feeling overwhelmed, both physically and emotionally. When stress accumulates over time, it can reduce our ability to cope and affect our overall wellbeing.</p>
            
            <p>Stress often arises from life events or pressures we place on ourselves—or feel from others. Work, relationships, bereavement, moving house, marriage, or redundancy can all increase stress levels. Sometimes, our own thoughts, feelings, and habits can amplify stress, creating unhelpful patterns.</p>
            
            <p>Prolonged stress affects the body as well as the mind. It can alter levels of cortisol, serotonin, and adrenaline, leaving you physically drained.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Common emotional signs of stress:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Feeling overwhelmed or anxious</li>
                <li>Irritability or low mood</li>
                <li>Low self-esteem</li>

            </ul>
            
            <p>If stress is affecting your life, therapy can help you manage symptoms and explore underlying causes. Together, you can identify triggers, develop coping strategies, and restore a sense of control over your physical and emotional wellbeing.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Supporting yourself while stressed:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Recognise the stress without self-blame</li>
                <li>Maintain daily routines and activities</li>
                <li>Practice relaxation techniques (e.g., deep breathing, mindfulness)</li>
                <li>Engage in light exercise or movement</li>
                <li>Talk to someone you trust about your feelings</li>
                <li>Take breaks from stressful situations when possible</li>
            </ul>
